TODO update new processing order

 Old Notes:

 ATX Processing chain:

    1 . Hotspot Extraction

        The first step in the processing chain is to iterate over all orbits in the
        dataset and extract any points which have raised radiances.  This is done
        using a specific script called by the bactch processor.

        a. Change line 196 of ggf_batch.py to 'ggf_extract_hotspots_atx.py '
        b. Run ggf_batch.py

    2. Hotspot aggregation

        Following detection, the hotspots are aggregated to a monthly dataset.

        a. Run data/flare_detection/atx/hotspot_orbits_to_hotspot_months.py

    3. Persistent hotspot detections

        Once aggregated to monthly files we check for hotspot persistence by
        looking for detections over 12 sample timeseries.  This generates a map
        of hotspots.

        a. Run data/flare_detecttion/atx/hotspot_months_to_flare_locations.py

    4.  Extract persistent hotspots and thier sampling information

        Use the map generated in step 3 to extract information in any orbit on
        the persistent hotspot locations.

        a. Change line 196 of ggf_batch.py to 'ggf_extract_flares_and_samples_atx.py '
        b. Run ggf_batch.py

    5. Generate persistent hotspot dataframe

        Aggregate all persistent hotspots into a dataframe

        a. Run data/flare_detection/atx/flare_orbits_to_flare_csv.py

    6. Generate persistent sampling dataframe

        Aggregate all sampling into into a dataframe

        a. Run data/sample_detection/atx/sample_orbits_to_sample_csv.py


 SLSTR Processing chain:

    Same as ats with different file names (sls in place of atx).
    Also need to run sls file remover
