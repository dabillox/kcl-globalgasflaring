 ATX Processing chain:

    1 . Hotspot Extraction

        The first step in the processing chain is to iterate over all orbits in the
        dataset and extract any points which have raised radiances.  This is done
        using a specific script called by the bactch processor.

        a. Change line 196 of ggf_batch.py to 'ggf_extract_hotspots_atx.py '
        b. Run ggf_batch.py

    2. Hotspot aggregation

        Following detection, the hotspots are aggregated to a monthly dataset.

        a. Run data/flare_detection/atx/hotspot_orbits_to_hotspot_months.py

    3. Persistent hotspot detections

        Once aggregated to monthly files we check for hotspot persistence by
        looking for detections over 12 sample timeseries.  This generates a map
        of hotspots.

        a. Run data/flare_detecttion/atx/hotspot_months_to_flare_locations.py

    4.  Extract persistent hotspots and thier sampling information

        Use the map generated in step 3 to extract information in any orbit on
        the persistent hotspot locations.

        a. Change line 196 of ggf_batch.py to 'ggf_extract_flares_and_samples_atx.py '
        b. Run ggf_batch.py

    5. Generate persistent hotspot dataframe

        Aggregate all persistent hotspots into a dataframe

        a. Run data/flare_detection/atx/flare_orbits_to_flare_csv.py

    6. Generate persistent sampling dataframe

        Aggregate all sampling into into a dataframe

        a. Run data/sample_detection/atx/sample_orbits_to_sample_csv.py


 SLSTR Processing chain:

    Same as ats with different file names (sls in place of atx).
    Also need to run sls file remover




  Old Notes:

  Running Order:

  1. ggf/ggf_extract_hotspots.py (using ggf/ggf_batch.py)
  2. data/flare_detection/hotspot_orbits_to_hotspot_months.py
  3. data/flare_detection/hotspot_months_to_flare_locations.py
  4. ggf/ggf_extract_flares_and_samples.py (using ggf/ggf_batch.py)


    ggf_extract_hotposts.py processes all ATSR orbits and detects the presence of pixels with radiances >0.1.
    It records the lat/lon position of these hotspots in a csv file "..._hotspots.csv" with the prefix being
    the ATSR filename.

    hotspot_orbits_to_hotspot_months.py iterates over all the hotspot.csv files and merges the individual orbits into monthly
    products.  It records all unique monthly hotspots into a single .csv file with the name 'MM.csv' where MM is
    the month.  It also adds two new columns lat_arcmin and lon_arcmin, which are the lat and lon locations
    represented as arcminutes in the decimals.

    hotspot_months_to_flare_locations.py reduces the month files to a set of all flares across the entire atsr time series
    providing a map of flaring activity across the planet from 1991-2012

    ggf_extract_flares_and_samples.py using the flare map, reprocesses all the orbits and checks whether any flare seen in the
    map are contined in the given orbit.  Also records all overpasses of a given flaring site
