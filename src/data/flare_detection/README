 ggf_detect_hotposts.py processes all ATSR orbits and detects the presence of pixels with radiances >0.1.
 It records the lat/lon position of these hotspots in a csv file "..._hotspots.csv" with the prefix being
 the ATSR filename.

 orbit_to_month.py iterates over all the hotspot.csv files and merges the individual orbits into monthly
 products.  It records all unique monthly hotspots into a single .csv file with the name 'MM.csv' where MM is
 the month.  It also adds two new columns lat_arcmin and lon_arcmin, which are the lat and lon locations
 represented as arcminute in the decimals.

 detect_flare_hotspots.py reduces the month files to a set of all flares across the entire atsr time series
 providing a map of flaring activity across the planet from 1991-2012

 ggf_extract_flares.py using the flare map, reprocesses all the orbits and checks whether any flare seen in the
 map are contined in the given orbit.
