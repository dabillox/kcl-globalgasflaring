This is the batch processing system used to produce global gas flaring datasets
from the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) sensor series and the Sea and Land
Surface Temperature Scanning Radiometer (SLSTR) instrument series.

The details of the algorithms used are described in detail in [1] and [2]. To provide
a quick summary here: Nighttime shortwave infrared (SWIR) image data is used to
identify thermal anomalies, which are then flagged as gas flaring activity if a
number of specific tests based on temporal and spectral characteristics are passed.

To run the batch processing systems first update the filepaths in src/config/filepaths
to your configuration and update the location of the python executable in the shebang
of the scripts: scripts.batch.flares.py and scripts.batch.hotspots.py

The various steps of the processor must be run in the correct order to produce
outputs.  The order is as follows:

$ python /src/scripts/batch/batch_submit.py hotspots [sensor]
$ python /src/scripts/identify_persistent_hotspots.py
$ python /src/scripts/batch/batch_submit.py flares [sensor]
$ python /src/scripts/aggregates_flares_samples.py

The [sensor] argument must be one of 'at1', 'at2', 'ats' or 'sls' corresponding to
ATSR1, ATSR2, AATSR and SLSTR.
